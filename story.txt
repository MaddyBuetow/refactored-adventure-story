Once upon a time, in a land far off in the mountains of an unknown region, there lived a girl who loved to explore.
 The girl found learning about new people, different places, and unique things absolutely invigorating. Not only did she express a strong interest in learning, but she had a penchant for it too.
 The girl’s exceptional memory and quick thinking did not go unnoticed by her parents, who did their best to foster her abilities. The only problem– the girl couldn’t go outside.
 For unknown medical reasons at the time, the girl was unable to adventure outdoors and was restricted to explore the world within the walls her own home. Fortunately for her, this was no problem.
 The plethora of books and trinkets her parents would bring home, was more than enough to keep her entertained for numerous lifetimes–or so she thought.

One day, the girl saw a weird white rabbit walking through her garden—it dressed, holding a pocket watch, talking to herself, and rushing. The curious girl followed it and jumped into the rabbit hole.
 This hole is an abyss. After a long time, the girl finally landed. She was shocked to see that she was in a strange hall, surrounded by large and small doors, and all the doors were locked.
 She picked up a key, but only opened a small door. Since the door was too small, she could only look over and found a Peugeot garden there. She placed the key on the table and found a bottle
 of "drink me" in the hall. Alice couldn't help but say that she had finished drinking it and found herself shrinking. When she could pass through the small door, she couldn't get back the key on
 the table. In the midst of panic, she picked up a cake that said "eat me." This time, after the girl ate it, she quickly became bigger and bigger, and even the top of her head was attached to the
 ceiling.

Alice picked up the White Rabbit's fan and began to shrink, and she  cried for help. "Oh, I'll never get back to the right size!"
She went looking for help and a green caterpillar dressed in a pink jacket told her to eat a piece of the mushroom he was perched upon.
Alice did so, and began to grow. "How do I get out of here?" Alice asked.
"That path leads to the Mad Hatter. The other way leads to Lae March Hare," said a voice from behind. She looked up to see a smiling cheshire cat in a tree. "I'll see you later at WWE smackdown featuring John Cena!"
