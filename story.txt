Once upon a time, in a land far off in the mountains of an unknown region, there lived a girl who loved to explore. The girl found learning about new people, different places, and unique things absolutely invigorating. Not only did she express a strong interest in learning, but she had a penchant for it too. The girl’s exceptional memory and quick thinking did not go unnoticed by her parents, who did their best to foster her abilities. The only problem– the girl couldn’t go outside. For unknown medical reasons at the time, the girl was unable to adventure outdoors and was restricted to explore the world within the walls her own home. Fortunately for her, this was no problem. The plethora of books and trinkets her parents would bring home, was more than enough to keep her entertained for numerous lifetimes–or so she thought.
